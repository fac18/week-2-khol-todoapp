 - Use CSS to make it look good.

### Our stretch goals 
- We were not able to achieve any of our stretch goals


### What we achieved:
  - Understood the reasoning for testing and how to write different tests.
  - How to write pure functions
  - Made the to-do app look pretty
  - We got a score of 100% accessbility.
 
 ### What we struggled with: 
 - At first we were unable to pass 1 test and that was for the markTodo.
 - We all struggled with the rendering the DOM, which meant we ran out of time to make the markTodo function work. 
 - We should have made it more responsive.
