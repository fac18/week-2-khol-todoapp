 ## Contents: 
* Tests for each function, 
* navigation button for About
* A contact form at the bottom of the page.

## the purpose of the to-do app:
 - Use TDD  and understand in order to test our logic.
 - Render the to-do list to the DOM
 - use CSS to make it look good.
 
## user stories completed 
- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them &#x2611;
- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day &#x2611;
- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left 

### our stretch goals 
- we were not able to achieve any of our stretch goals


### what we achieved:
  - understood the reasoning for testing and how to write different tests.
  - how to write pure functions
  - made the to-do app look pretty
 
 ### what we struggled with: 
 - At first we were unable to pass 1 test and that was for the markTodo.
 - we all struggled with the rendering the DOM, which meant we ran out of time to make the markTodo function work.
